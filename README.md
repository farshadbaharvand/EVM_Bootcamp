# ðŸ“š EVM Bootcamp Notes & Resources

This repository contains my **structured notes, diagrams, tables, and summaries** from the [Encode Club EVM Bootcamp](https://encode.club/), held **Juneâ€“July 2025**.  
It covers Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) internals, Solidity development, DeFi, NFTs, smart contract security, and Layer 2 scaling â€” organized for easy reference.

> ðŸŽ¯ Goal: To create a clear, visual, and developer-friendly reference for Ethereum smart contract development.
